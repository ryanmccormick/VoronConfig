# VoronConfig
I am in the process of completing my Voron 2.4 build and have been running into a variety of different issues with getting Klipper + SKR2 boards up and running - currently some processor clock sync issue and variation between different boards. Klipper seems to be a really cool idea but I am really looking for reliability and needed to pivot. Since I have pretty extensive experience with the duet product line, I have decided to switch to a Duet 3 6HC Mainboard with a 1LC toolboard for the Afterburner.

## Attribution

To ensure that I am giving proper attribution to the root of this configuration, I wanted to be sure to acknowledge the work of LaKoBlue and Norb.


A configuration of a Voron 2.2/2.4 3d printer using duet mainboard and reprap firmware 3.x.


This configuration is a fork from [LaKoBlue's config](https://github.com/LaKoBlue/VoronConfig) which was derived as a fork from [Norbs config](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/legacy_printers/firmware_configurations/reprapfirmware/Norbs). LakoBlue added some small changes and additional comments in the files.

In addition to configuration changes, LaKoBlue was awesome enough to document his printer build in this [document](./docs/printer.md) and also get a start on a [setup guide](./docs/setup.md).

## My Changes

I started this fork on 07/24/2021 and will update this placeholder as I make changes.
